# AI-Assisted Software Design Exercise

## Description
This is a simple Java username and password generator that was created by OpenAI's ChatGPT (version 3.5) Large Language Model (LLM). 

In this codebase, the `generateUsername` method generates a six-character username using lowercase letters, and the `generatePassword` method generates a password of a specified length containing a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. You can customize the length and character sets according to your requirements. This is a basic implementation and may not be suitable for production-level security.

## Use Cases
The following are the use cases for this application:
1. The user can generate a six-character username.
2. The user can generate a password of a specified length.

## User Stories
The following user stories are generated from the above use cases:
* As a user, I want to be able to generate a six-character username so that I do not have to think of a new username when creating an account for something.
* As a user, I want to be able to generate a password of a specified length so that I do not have to think of a new password when creating an account for something.

## Design Patterns
The following design patterns were used within the generated code:
* 

## Implementation Details
The project has the following settings:
* **SDK**: Amazon Corretto Version 11.0.19
* **Java Language Level**: 10 - Local variable type inference

The sequence of ChatGPT prompts that were used to create and analyze this codebase are specified below:
